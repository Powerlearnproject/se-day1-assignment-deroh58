#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It involves a structured and disciplined approach to creating software that is reliable, efficient, and meets the needs of its users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968): his event is widely considered the formal birth of the discipline. The conference highlighted the growing complexity of software systems and the need for more structured approaches to software development. 
The Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s): Structured programming emerged as a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of software by using control structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines, and by avoiding the use of "goto" statements. 
The Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001): Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by promoting adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement. It helped teams respond more effectively to changing requirements and increased the speed and flexibility of software delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: This is the initial phase where the projectâ€™s objectives, scope, purpose, and feasibility are determined.
Requirement Analysis: In this phase, detailed requirements of the software system are gathered from stakeholders. These requirements describe what the system should do, including functional and non-functional requirements.
Design: The design phase involves creating the architecture of the software system. This includes high-level system architecture and detailed design, such as database schema, user interfaces, and algorithms.
Implementation: During implementation, the actual code for the software is written based on the design documents. This is where developers translate design into a working software product.
Testing: The testing phase involves verifying that the software works as intended.
Deployment: In this phase, the software is released to the production environment where it will be used by the end-users. This may involve installation, configuration, and user training.
Maintenance: The software enters the maintenance phase where it is monitored for bugs or issues. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology: is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It typically follows these stages: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
Agile Methodology:  is an iterative and incremental approach where development is done in small cycles called sprints. Each sprint delivers a potentially shippable product increment.
Scenarios
Waterfall:
Example Scenario: Developing a spacecraft's control system for a mission to Mars. This project requires strict adherence to specifications, extensive documentation, and minimal changes once the design is finalized.
Appropriate When: Requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change, such as in construction projects, government contracts, or regulatory compliance projects.
Agile:
Example Scenario: Developing a mobile app for a startup that is still discovering its market. The team needs to adapt quickly to user feedback and changing market conditions.
Appropriate When: The project requires flexibility, customer feedback, and rapid iteration, such as in software development for dynamic environments, startups, or digital products where requirements evolve.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: The primary role of a software developer is to design, code, and implement software applications according to the requirements specified by the project team.
Quality Assurance Engineer: A QA engineer ensures that the software meets the required quality standards before it is released to users. They focus on identifying defects, improving software quality, and ensuring the software is reliable and performs as expected.
Project Manager: The project manager oversees the entire software development process, ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the specified requirements. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs: IDEs integrate various tools and features that streamline the development process. This includes code editors, debuggers, compilers, and build automation tools, all within a single environment. examples include Visual studio code which is a lightweight open source IDE supporting wide range of programming languages and extensions.
2. Version Control Systems: VCS allows developers to track and manage changes to the source code over time. This is essential for maintaining the integrity of the codebase, especially when multiple developers are working on the same project. Example is Git which is llows for distributed development, meaning each developer has a full copy of the codebase and history on their local machine.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Managing Complex Codebases
Challenges: Code complexity increases with project size.
            Difficulties in understanding, maintaining, and debugging.
Strategies: Modular design and code organization.
            Regular code reviews.
             Periodic refactoring.
            Comprehensive documentation.
2. Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technologies
Challenges: Fast-paced technological advancements.
            Overwhelming to stay current.
Strategies: Continuous learning (courses, workshops, blogs).
            Peer learning and collaboration.
            Focus on mastering key technologies.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure that each part works correctly.it is important in early bug detection and code documentation
Intergration testing: involves testing the interaction between integrated components or modules to ensure they work together as expected.It is important  in interface testing.
system testing: involves testing the complete, integrated system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements. it is important in validating the entire software system to ensure it functions correctly in its entirety.
Acceptance testing: esting conducted to determine whether the software is ready for release, often done by the end-users or clients. it helps ensure client satisfaction. 



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, particularly language models like GPT. Well-crafted prompts help ensure that the AI understands the user's intent and provides accurate and relevant answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of vague prompt : "Tell me about technology"
Improved prompt: "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on how AI is used in diagnostics and patient care."
The improved prompt specifies the aspect of technology (artificial intelligence) and the field of application (healthcare), making it clear what information is being sought.
